  <h1>Lurcher<br><br><br></h1>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Muhammad Maaz, <strong>Published:</strong> 11th, June , 2015<br><br><br></p>

            <div>
                <img src="images/dogs/Lurcher.jpg" height="200px" width="300px" style="float:left;" >
            </div>

            <p>The Lurcher has a short coat and a smooth undercoat that thickens in the winter. The legs are long and straight. The chest is deep, providing lung capacity for endurance. The small, wire-haired ears are high set. The small, dark eyes are round and alert. Colors vary widely since the Lurcher is derived from sighthound crosses. There is also a longhaired variety. <br><br><br>
            
            </p>
            <p>Both the longhaired and shorthaired variety of the Lurcher should be combed and brushed regularly. Some Lurchers are constant shedders, while others are average shedders.
<br><br><br>
Beautiful but reserved, the Saluki is affectionate without being overly demonstrative. He's happy to prove his loyalty through quiet companionship. Not everyone is offered the gift of a Saluki's devoted friendship, but those happy few who receive it are appreciative of the honor.
<br><br><br>
Salukis are widely admired for their exotic appearance, but not everyone is well suited to live with this spirited and independent hunter. Any movement, be it a squirrel, cat, or radio-controlled car, will activate the Saluki's instinct to chase, and his speed has been clocked at 30 to 35 miles per hour.
<br><br><br>
Unless he's protected by a strong human on the other end of the leash or a securely fenced yard, he's likely to meet his end beneath the wheels of a car. You might think that Salukis living in the country would have fewer issues, but they've been known to chase down and tangle with or kill goats, otters, foxes, raccoons, snakes, squirrels, and deer.<br><br><br>

Both the longhaired and shorthaired variety of the Lurcher should be combed and brushed regularly. Some Lurchers are constant shedders, while others are average shedders.<br><br><br></p>
