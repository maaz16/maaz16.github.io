  <h1>Whippet<br><br><br></h1>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Muhammad Maaz, <strong>Published:</strong> 11th, June , 2015<br><br><br></p>

            <div>
                <img src="images/dogs/Whippet.jpg" height="250px" width="300px" style="float:left;" >
            </div>

            <p>The Whippet dog breed was a poacher's best friend, speedily going after rabbits and other small game. Today the Whippet competes in agility, flyball, lure coursing, rally, and obedience and is a loving therapy dog. His unique nature, friendly personality, and stylish look make him a favorite as a family companion as well as in the show ring.<br><br><br>
            
            </p>
            <p>Nicknamed the "poor man's Greyhound," the elegant yet powerful Whippet was probably created some time in the late 18th century for use by poachers in search of rabbits and other small game, as well as in "snap" contests, in which the goal was for the dog to snap up rabbits in a circle. They really came into their own, however, when it was discovered that they would chase a waving rag, and Whippet racing became popular among working class men.
<br><br><br>
This medium-size hound has a short, dense coat in a variety of colors and markings covering a streamlined body. The Whippet is not a miniature Greyhound but was developed by crossing Greyhounds with smaller terriers and, later, Italian Greyhounds. The result was a sleek and beautiful dog who's gentle and affectionate.<br><br><br>


That same prey drive that makes Whippets unsuitable to homes with cats makes them unsuitable to walks off leash. They will give chase if they see something worth chasing, and even a well-trained Whippet will disregard commands to come. Some have pursued prey for miles.<br><br><br>

Whippets enjoy daily walks, and an opportunity to run in a fenced yard or other confined area is always appreciated. An underground electronic fence is not sufficient to keep them contained; they'll ignore the shock it gives in favor of going after any moving object.<br><br><br>

In the home, they're gentle and undemanding, asking only to enjoy your company. With children they're playful and mischievous. Their thin coats and affectionate nature make them unsuited to living outdoors. Whippets will snuggle with you on the sofa and warm your feet in bed at the end of an active day<br><br><br></p>
